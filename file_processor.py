"""Helper functions for reading subtitles and extracting text from media files.

This module contains simple utility functions that read the contents of
subtitle or text files associated with videos. If no subtitle is
available, it also includes stubs for audio extraction and
transcription. These can be expanded in the future to perform actual
speech‑to‑text conversion using libraries like MoviePy and Whisper.
