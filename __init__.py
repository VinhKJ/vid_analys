"""Package initialization for the video_analyzer project.

This package contains modules that work together to provide a simple
graphical application for scanning directories of course videos, pairing
each video with its subtitles or accompanying text where available,
communicating with an AI API to analyse the contents and summarise them,
and finally writing the results into a study guide file.  The
`VideoAnalyzerApp` class in `gui.py` defines the GUI and orchestrates
the processing flow.

To run the application from the command line, execute `python main.py`.
